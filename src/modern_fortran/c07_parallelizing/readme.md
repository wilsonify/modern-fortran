In Fortran, you can use the !$acc and !$omp directives to specify the kind of
parallelism you want.
The !$acc directive allows you to take advantage of GPU acceleration, while the
!$omp directive lets you take advantage of shared-memory parallelism.
You can also use parallel loops with the do concurrent statement or use the
parallel construct for parallel regions.
The parallel region construct lets you specify blocks of code that should be executed
in parallel, as well as the number of threads to use and the schedule for dividing
work between threads.
You should use the parallel region construct in combination with the critical
construct to protect critical sections of code that should only be executed by
one thread at a time.
In addition to the parallel construct, Fortran provides a number of other
mechanisms to help you manage parallelism, including tasks, which allow you
to explicitly specify dependencies between parallel operations, and teams,
which allow you to group threads together to work on a specific set of tasks.
You should also use the parallelization features in your Fortran compiler to
help you optimize your code. Most compilers include features like auto-
parallelization, vectorization, and OpenMP or OpenACC support.


In Fortran, you can implement parallelism in a few ways, including using
OpenMP or MPI libraries, as well as using coarrays, which are a built-in
feature of the language.

OpenMP is a high-level API for parallel programming that provides a simple
way to parallelize loops and other parts of your code. You can specify how
many threads to use, and OpenMP takes care of the rest.

MPI, or Message Passing Interface, is a lower-level API for parallel program-
ming. It provides a way to send messages between images, and it’s used by
many HPC applications.

Coarrays, on the other hand, allow you to define arrays that are spread
across multiple images, and they provide a high-level syntax for synchronizing
and copying data between images.

When writing parallel code, it’s important to keep in mind that the more
images you use, the more communication overhead you will have. To make
the most of your parallel code, you need to balance computation and commu-
nication in a way that minimizes the overhead.

In general, you should aim to distribute your data evenly among images, so
that each image has roughly the same amount of work to do. You should also
try to minimize the amount of data that needs to be copied between images,
and you should use the sync all statement judiciously to ensure that all
images are properly synchronized.
