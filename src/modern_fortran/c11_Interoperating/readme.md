you can interface with libraries written in C or C++, such as
OpenMP, MPI, OpenCV, or TensorFlow, by defining an interface in Fortran that
matches the C functions you want to use.

This way, you can easily access the functionality provided by these libraries and
combine it with your own Fortran code, maximizing your productivity and expanding
the range of problems you can solve.

Additionally, using the interoperability features provided by Fortran, you can
also expose your own Fortran subroutines and functions to be used from C or C++
programs, making your code reusable across different programming languages.


The Fortran-C interoperability feature is useful for calling existing C functions from Fortran and vice versa.
 

This allows you to utilize the strengths of both languages in a single program 
and to incorporate legacy code written in C into your Fortran program.
 The C function can be made available to Fortran by defining a function interface that binds to the target C function.
 The iso_c_binding module provides data types that are compatible with C data types, 
allowing you to easily map C data types to Fortran data types.


With the bind(c) attribute, you can specify that the Fortran interface will match an existing C function.
 The optional argument name allows you to specify the C function name to bind to.
 Similarly, Fortran derived types with the bind(c) attribute are paired with matching C structs.


The value attribute in the argument definition in 
the Fortran interface is used for pass-by-value arguments to C functions (nonpointers).
 This ensures compatibility between the C and Fortran data types.


It is important to note that C and Fortran have different memory management and calling conventions, 
so it is important to understand these differences when working with Fortran-C interoperability.
 However, with a good understanding of both languages, 
you can harness the power of Fortran-C interoperability to greatly expand the functionality of your Fortran programs.
