Derived types also allow you to define user-defined data types, which can have a more intuitive
representation than the built-in data types.
 For example, you could define a type "Person" that has
components "name" and "age".
 This makes the code more readable and maintainable.


The derived types can be passed as arguments to procedures or functions, and can be used in any
manner just like built-in data types.


With derived types, you can also define specific data operations that can be applied to instances of
that type.
 These operations are known as "type-bound procedures" or "methods".
 Methods can be
declared as public or private, and allow you to encapsulate the implementation details for a
particular type.


You can also overload intrinsic operators for a derived type, making it easier to perform operations
on instances of that type in a natural and intuitive way.


In summary, derived types are a powerful feature in Fortran that allow you to model complex data
structures, encapsulate implementation details, and provide a more natural representation of data.


Derived types are similar to classes in object-oriented programming languages.
 

The primary difference is that derived types are usually 
used for a more specific and performance-critical purpose than general-purpose classes.


Derived types can be used to create user-defined data structures in Fortran, 
where you can define variables, arrays, and procedures within a single entity.
 

This makes it easy to work with complex data structures in Fortran, as you can encapsulate data and behavior within a single entity.

Derived types can also have public and private components, just like modules.
 You can define public components that can be accessed by other parts of your code, 
and private components that are only accessible within the derived type.

Derived types can also have procedures or methods associated with them, 
which can manipulate the data in the derived type.

 These procedures can be defined with the function or subroutine keyword, 
and they can be invoked on instances of the derived type.

In addition to defining new data structures, 
you can also extend existing derived types, using the type extension mechanism.

This allows you to inherit the data and behavior from an existing derived type, 
and add new components or override existing ones as needed.
