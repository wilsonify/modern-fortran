In addition to custom operators, 
type-bound procedures can also be used to implement constructors and destructors, 
procedures to convert between data types, and procedures for querying the size or shape of the data.
 
The use of custom operators and type-bound procedures allows for a more object-oriented approach to programming in Fortran and can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
 However, as with generic procedures, it is important to use custom operators and type-bound procedures sparingly, 
as overuse can lead to code that is more complex and harder to understand.

Custom operators are a very important feature in Fortran, 
as they allow you to create a new and simpler syntax for your code, 
making it more readable and easier to maintain.

 Custom operators can be used to implement complex functionality, 
 such as element-wise operations, 
 arithmetic operations, and comparison operations.
 
Custom operators are implemented by defining type-bound procedures, 
which are procedures that are associated with a specific data type.
 
These procedures can be called using the custom operator syntax, 
and can be overridden by more specialized implementations.


One of the benefits of custom operators is that they provide a higher level of abstraction, 
as they can hide complex low-level tasks, such as parallel synchronization, error handling, and data validation.
 Custom operators can also be used to extend the functionality of existing data types, 
such as adding support for new mathematical operations, or customizing the behavior of existing operations.


Overall, custom operators are a powerful tool for improving the readability and maintainability of Fortran code, 
and they can be used to implement complex functionality in a simple and elegant way.
