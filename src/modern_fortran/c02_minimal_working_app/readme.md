Here are some of the basics of Fortran programming. 

The compilation and linking steps are crucial for building an executable program, 
and the program units, 
such as the main program, function, subroutine, module, and submodule, 
allow you to structure your code and organize your functions.

In Fortran, it's important to declare your variables before you use them, 
and using the implicit none statement at the top of your code ensures that all variables are declared explicitly. 

There are five built-in data types in Fortran, 
and you can use if blocks to test for conditions and take different execution branches based on the values. 

The stop statement is used to immediately abort the program and print a message to the terminal.

Do loops are used to iterate over sections of code a specified number of times, 
and the arithmetic rules in Fortran follow the standard order of operations. 

Finally, 
the print * statement is a convenient way to print the values of any variable or literal constant to the terminal.
