Modern Fortran
=====

"Modern Fortran" is a book that aims to teach modern Fortran through practical, hands-on examples, 
with a focus on parallel programming and the latest developments in the language. 

The book is aimed at scientists and engineers who want to use Fortran to solve challenging computational problems.

The book covers the most essential features of Fortran that are likely to be used in scientific and engineering work, 
and provides examples ranging from simple note-taking apps to more complex simulations, 
including parallel tsunami simulations. 

The book also gives extra attention to parallel programming in Fortran, 
including using coarrays, teams, events, and collectives.

Overall, "Modern Fortran" is intended to be a practical and 
useful reference text for scientists and engineers who want to use Fortran to solve real-world problems.

# Features

* [c04 - organizing](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc04_organizing)
* [c05 - analyzing arrays](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc05_analyzing_arrays)
* [c06 - formatting data](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc06_formatting_data)
* [c07 - parallelizing](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc07_parallelizing)
* [c08 - abstracting](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc08_abstracting)
* [c09 - generalizing](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc09_generalizing)
* [c10 - defining operators](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc10_defining_operators)
* [c11 - Interoperating](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc11_Interoperating)
* [c12 - parallelism and teams](src%2Fmodern_fortran%2Fc12_parallelism_teams)

Each chapter includes practical examples and exercises 
that are designed to help readers learn and apply the concepts covered in the chapter.

In addition to covering the basics of Fortran programming, 
the book also includes chapters on more advanced topics, 
such as scientific computing, 
data analysis, and simulation. 

These chapters include more complex examples and exercises 
that are designed to challenge readers and help them develop their skills.

One of the unique features of "Modern Fortran" is its focus on parallel programming in Fortran. 

The book includes several chapters that cover parallel programming concepts and techniques, 
including using coarrays, teams, events, and collectives. 

These chapters are designed to help readers take advantage of Fortran's built-in support for parallel programming, 
without relying on external libraries such as MPI.

Overall, "Modern Fortran" is a comprehensive and practical guide to Fortran programming, 
with a focus on real-world applications and parallel programming. 

It is a useful resource for scientists, engineers, 
and anyone else who wants to learn Fortran or improve their Fortran skills.
